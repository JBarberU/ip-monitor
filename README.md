# ip-monitor 

ip-monitor is a small utility for logging changes to your local ip-address.
It was made for debugging a shaky wifi connection, but might be useful for 
other stuff as well.

## Usage

```bash
-h) This help page
-o) The logfile to write to (default is \"$LOG_FILE\")
-i) The interval between ip checks (default is \"$INTERVAL\")
```

## Todo

- Implement the get_ip function for GNU/Linux and perhaps BSDs
